\begin{enumerate}[\thesection-1]
%
\item An $n$-string has $(n - k + 1)$ $k$-substrings, where $1 \leq k \leq n$. Therefore, an $n$-string has in total
\[
\sum^n_{k = 1} (n - k + 1) = \frac{1}{2}n(n + 1)
\]
substrings.
%
\item There are $2^{2^n}$ $n$-input, $1$-output boolean functions. There are $2^{m2^n}$ $n$-input, $m$-output boolean functions.
%
\item $(n - 1)!$.
%
\item (Hint) There are 49 even numbers and 50 odd numbers in the set $\sete{1, 2, \ldots, 99}$. There are two cases in which the sum of the three distinct numbers chosen from this set is even: \begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item all are even, \item one is even, the other two are odd. \end{inparaenum} Also, make use of rules of sum and of product.
